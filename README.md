# todoApp

This is a simple todo application built with vanilla js, html, and css, that is meant to be a cumulitive knowledge milestone prior to moving on to learning frontend and backend frameworks. All of the js is comprised in a single file and attempts to utilize the Model View Controller (MVC) framework for application development.

> I would love any feedback on what is broken or misused and suggestions on what could be done better!

## Outstanding Tasks

- [ ] Add Project support - Each todo list will be stored in its own project. The user can CRUD projects and switch between them within the app.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the root folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. **Setup App** - You can either run the application in dev or prod
   - Dev - Use `npm run dev` to setup a local server
   - Prod - Open `dist/index.html` file in your browser (you can run `npm run build` to create a new prod build if needed)
4. **Test and Provide Feedback**
